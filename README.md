# SpiralMind Roadmap 🛣️

## In Progress

1. Implement user permission settings for collaborative editing.
3. Consider implementing a web-based editor for increased accessibility.

## Upcoming Milestones

4. Develop a keyword map generator functionality.
5. Enable export/import capability for mindmaps in JSON format.

## Future Ideas

Once the web-based editor is launched, here are some potential enhancements:

1. **Advanced Visualization Options:** Implement various themes, styles, or templates for mind maps.
2. **Customizable Templates:** Allow users to create and save custom templates for recurring use or specific purposes.
3. **Interactive Elements:** Introduce checkboxes, hyperlinks, or multimedia attachments within mind map nodes.
4. **Real-time Collaboration:** Investigate live collaboration features, enabling multiple users to work simultaneously. (Further exploration required)

This roadmap outlines our ongoing and upcoming developments for SpiralMind Bot. Join us as we work towards enhancing mind-mapping experiences within Discord servers!
