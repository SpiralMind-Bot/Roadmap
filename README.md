# SpiralMind Roadmap üõ£Ô∏è

## In Progress

1. Implement user permission settings for collaborative editing.
2. Rebuild the website using Next.js integrated with OAuth for enhanced security.

## Upcoming Milestones

3. Develop a keyword map generator functionality.
4. Enable export/import capability for mindmaps in JSON format.
5. Consider implementing a web-based editor for increased accessibility.

## Future Ideas

Once the web-based editor is launched, here are some potential enhancements:

1. **Advanced Visualization Options:** Implement various themes, styles, or templates for mind maps.
2. **Customizable Templates:** Allow users to create and save custom templates for recurring use or specific purposes.
3. **Interactive Elements:** Introduce checkboxes, hyperlinks, or multimedia attachments within mind map nodes.
4. **Real-time Collaboration:** Investigate live collaboration features, enabling multiple users to work simultaneously. (Further exploration required)
